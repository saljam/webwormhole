WebWormhole creates ephemeral pipes between computers to send files
or other data. Try it at https://webwormhole.io or on the command
line.

On one computer the tool generates a one-time code for us:

	$ cat hello.txt
	hello, world
	$ ww send hello.txt
	8-enlist-decadence

On another we use the code to establish a connection:

	$ ww receive 8-enlist-decadence
	$ cat hello.txt
	hello, world

To install:

	$ go get webwormhole.io/cmd/ww

Requires Go 1.13.

The author runs an instance of the signalling server that is free to
use at https://webwormhole.io. It comes with no SLAs or any guarantees
of uptime.

To run the signalling server you need to compile the WebAssembly
files first.  Running go generate will execute the appropriate
commands to do that:

	$ go generate ./web
	$ ww server -https= -http=localhost:8000

WebWormhole is inspired by and uses a model very similar to that
of Magic Wormhole. Thanks Brian!

It differs from Magic Wormhole in that it uses WebRTC to make the
direct peer connections. This allows us to make use of WebRTC's NAT
traversal tricks, as well as the fact that it can be used in browsers.
The exchange of session descriptions (offers and answers) is protected
by PAKE and a generated random password, similar to Magic Wormhole.
The session descriptions include the fingerprints of the DTLS
certificates that WebRTC uses to secure its communications.
